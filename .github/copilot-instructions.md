# GitHub Copilot Instruction Pointer

## CRITICAL: Read Full Instructions from `AGENTS.md`

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of every conversation, you must read the `AGENTS.md` file located at the project root to load the complete set of automation guidelines for this repository.

**File location**: `../AGENTS.md`

**Why this setup?**

- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for all agent instructions
- This file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) is the entry point that GitHub Copilot reads automatically
- Its only job is to direct you to `AGENTS.md` for the authoritative instructions

**Your first action**: Read `../AGENTS.md` immediately and follow every requirement it outlines.
